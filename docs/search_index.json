(It is highly likely that Frisians were also part of that group) The Germanic tribes forced the Celts to move to the West, burned down the Roman towns and destroyed the civilization as had been attained under Roman influence. Angles-Saxons-Jutes-Frisians Various tribes combined to form small kingdoms; seven of these were Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, Kent, Essex, Sussex, and Wessex (the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy) - Germanic roots preserved in place names: ing (Reading) = people of, ham (Nottingham) = Farm, ton (Wigton) = fortified place, etc. - Germanic word stock in basic terms/words: is: is, have: habban, man: mann, woman: wif, child: cild, house: hus, food: mete, eat: etan, drink: drincan, fight: feohtan, etc. 5.2 Old English Literature Anglo-Saxon literature is the richest and most significant of any preserved among the early Germanic peoples. Anglo-Saxons poets sang of the things they most deeply experienced: war, exile, the sea, ruined cities, and minstrel life More than half of Anglo-Saxon poetry is concerned with Christian subjects. 5.3 Old English Writing The first written records used futhorc (runic alphabet) Only after 700 appeared the first texts written in Roman alphabet The Roman alphabet was not designed to represent OE sounds! The most important piece of Old English poetry is the epic of the Geatish warrior Beowulf who slays the monster Grindel and dies during a fight against a dragon. 5.4 Old English Consonants Orthography IPA Pronunciation Example \\(&lt;\\)sc\\(&gt;\\) [ʒ] scip ‘ship’ [sk] ascian ‘ask’ \\(&lt;\\)c\\(&gt;\\) [k] cneo ‘knee’ [tʃ] cild, rice ‘child’, ‘kingdom’ \\(&lt;\\)h\\(&gt;\\) [h] hus, hwæt ‘house’, ‘what’ [x] niht ‘night’ [ɣ] leoht, hlaf ‘light’, ‘loaf’ \\(&lt;\\)g\\(&gt;\\) [ɡ] gast ‘ghost’ [j] gif ‘if’ [j] dagas ‘days’ \\(&lt;\\)cg\\(&gt;\\) [ɡɡ] docga ‘dog’ [dj] ecg ‘edge’ Fricatives complementary distribution: intervocalic – voiced; word-final – voiceless \\(&lt;\\)f\\(&gt;\\) [f] fot ‘foot’ [v] heofon ‘heaven’ \\(&lt;\\)s\\(&gt;\\) [s] swa, mus ‘so’, ‘mouse’ [z] risan ‘rise’ \\(&lt;\\)r\\(&gt;\\) Alveolar Trill Geminates pronounced long As a Germanic language, English shares certain characteristics common to all Germanic languages “Weak” and “strong” declension of adjectives: ein schöner Mann : der schöne Mann Distinctive types of verb conjugation: Present: gehe, gehst, geht Past: ging, gingst Stressing the first or the root syllable of words: “kriegerrisch”, “bekriegen”, “kriegen”, etc. 5.5 Old English Dialects Four major dialects West Saxon (most texts that were preserved are written in West Saxon) Kentish Anglian Mercian (plus Northumbrian) West Saxon Entire word stock in Old English approximately 25,000 words (today 750,000 words but average educated person’s active word stock approximately 10,000 words) Determiners, adjectives, and nouns were fully inflected: The king : se cyning of the king : thaes cyninges to the king : thaem cyninge Word order did not matter (as much): Se cyning meteth thone biscop = Thone biscop meteth se cyning The king meets the bishop ≠ The bishop meets the king Anglo Invasion Germanic tribes were pagans as we can still detect in English weekdays (Woden: Wednesday, Thor: Thursday, Fria: Friday). From the sixth to the eighth century the Anglo-Saxons were converted to Christianity. Latin (language of religion) came to influence English angel, bishop, candle, church, martyr, priest, school, … 5.5.1 Characteristics of Old English Old English differs from Modern English on all levels. Old English contains remarkably few words derived from Latin and almost none derived from French (which make up half of the words now in common use). The Old English vocabulary is almost entirely Germanic. 85 percent of Old English words are no longer in use today (compensated by adoption of French during Middle English: ger. lyft \\(\\rightarrow\\) fr. aire) Old English was synthetic \\(\\rightarrow\\) syntactic relations are indicated via inflection rather than word order Stops Affricate Fricative Nasal Liquids Glides Bilabial /p/ /p:/ /m/ /m:/ /w/ /b/ /b:/ Labiodental /f/ /f:/ Dental /T/ /T:/ /n/ /n:/ Alveolar /t/ /t:/ /s/ /s:/ /l/ /l:/ /d/ /d:/ /r/ /r:/ Palato-alveolar /tS/ /tS:/ /dZ/ /dZ:/ Palatal /j/ Velar /k/ /k:/ /x/ /x:/ /g g:/ Phoneme Trans.

Indefinite articles were rarely used for at least two reasons: the case system fulfilled the role of modern indefinite articles and thus there was no need for them as “a” and “an” still possessed their number meaning and were thus inflected like adjectives the/that/those | Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter | Plural | |————-|———–|———-|——–|———-| | Nominative | se | þæt | sēo | þā | | Accusative | þone | þæt | þā | þā | | Genitive | þæs | þæs | þǣre | þāra, þǣra| | Dative | þǣm | þǣm | þǣre | þǣm, þām | | Instrumental| þȳ, þon | þȳ, þon | þāra | þǣm | this/these/yon | Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter | Plural | |————-|———–|———-|——–|———| | Nominative | þes | þis | þēos | þās | | Accusative | þisne | þis | þās | þās | | Genitive | þisses | þisses | þisse, þisre | þisra | | Dative | þissum | þissum | þisse, þisre | þissum | | Instrumental| þȳs | þȳs | īes | īos | (Personal) Pronouns - Like in almost all languages, the personal pronouns in Old English preserved a complete system of inflections (for gender, person, and case) and had a dual case, i.e. a set of forms for two people or two things.

Beginning their invasion in 793 in Lindisfarne, they had conquered almost all of Britain by 878 when Alfred the Great won in a last attempt to withstand the invasion in Edington. They destroyed monasteries (written documents) and killed or enslaved the native population. Peace treaty between Vikings and Alfred: division of England into the Danelaw (Viking rule) and Wessex (only remaining Anglo-Saxon kingdom). Had Alfred not won, Britain would be Scandinavian today. Alfred united the remaining Anglo-Saxons and revitalized English (education, poetry, and official documents in Old English) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
