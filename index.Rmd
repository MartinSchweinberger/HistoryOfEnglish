# Course information

## Course description

This course addresses how and why languages change and introduces students to the history of the English language. During the sessions, we will discuss different periods of English, their linguistic features as well as the cultural forces that characterize and have shaped them. In addition, this course will familiarize students with basic concepts of historical linguistics, e.g. family trees and reconstruction, and will elaborate on how language is analyzed from a diachronic perspective using hands-on corpus exercises to investigate selected features (diachronic changes of nominal suffixes and the alternation in the 3rd person singular morpheme). Finally, students will learn about different types of changes, i.e. how changes affect distinct levels of the linguistic system (sound change, semantic change, grammaticalization), and their social embedding (historical sociolinguistics).
