## Pre-English


### Stone Age: 6000-2000 BC

**First Phase (Mesolithic Age)**

- Little is known about the first settlers of Britain and archaeological findings do not tell us anything about language.
- Evidence for approximately 1,500 campsites on British ground with a population of around 100,000 hunter-gatherers.
- Tools made from wood and flint, homes made of wood huts.

**Second Phase (Neolithic Age)**

- Farming was introduced around 3,500 BC (20-40% of genetic material from Syria, Iran, etc.).
- Permanent settlements form and deforestation takes place.
- Homes have flowing water (indoor toilets), jewelry, living rooms, shelves, etc.
- Religious burial sites emerge (evidence for ritualistic cannibalism).

- First Celtic arrival (2000-1200 BC).
- Goidelic-speaking (parent of Modern Scottish and Irish Gaelic).

### Iron Age: 700 BC-43 AD

- By 700, the manufacturing of iron replaced bronze.
- The use of iron increased agricultural productivity which led to population growth.
- Trading became common and markets emerged (early towns) and pre-modern society.
- Population growth and the modern iron swords led to more conflicts and war-ideology (fortifications around towns are being built).

- Second arrival of Celts (500-400 BC).
- Brythonic-speaking (Parent of modern Welsh and Cornish).
- First linguistic evidence (runic inscriptions).
- Some traces of the Celtic language (similar to Basque language) are preserved mainly in place names (tor (Torpenhow) = peak, caer (Carlisle) = fortified place, Thames = dark river, lin(do) = lake, avon = river, Cymru (Welsh name for Wales): Cambrian, Cumberland, Cumbria).

### The Romans in Britain

- A.D. 43: The Romans (under Emperor Claudius) conquer Britain and take control of almost all what is now England for more than 300 years (43-410 AD).
- Romanization of England includes the implementation of Latin as the official language.
- Latin (of that period) had a very weak influence on the development of the English language.
- Latin did not replace the Celtic language: its use was confined to members of the upper class.
- After 410, when the last Roman legions were drawn from the island, the influence of Latin decreased.
