### Family Tree

Sir William Jones, a British government official, wrote in India in 1796:

> "The Sanskrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure, more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in roots of verbs and in the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident."

During the 19th century, linguists inferred that most European languages share a common ancestor (Proto-Indo-European), which was spoken in the Caucasus mountains around 4000 BC.
