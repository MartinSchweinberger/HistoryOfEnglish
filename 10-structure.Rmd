From SOV in OE to SVO in PDE? 

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{exe}
\ex Gregory made him flee. (PDE: SVO)
\ex \gll Gregorius [hine_{object}] [afligde_{verb}] (Homilies of Ã†lfric, 22.624)\\
Gregory him put-to-flight\\
\glt "Gregory made him flee"

\begin{footnotesize}
SOV
\begin{exe}
\ex \gll Gregorius $[$hine$_{object}]$ $[$afligde$_{verb}]$ (Homilies of \AE lfric, 22.624)\\
Gregory him put-to-flight\\
\glt \textquote{Gregory made him flee}
\end{exe}
SVO if Object is a full DP or NP
\begin{exe}
\ex \gll Gregorius $[$afligde$_{verb}]$ $[$\textthorn one guman$_{object}]$ \\
Gregorius put-to-flight the man \\
\glt \textquote{Gregorius made the man flee.}
\end{exe}
AuxSOV if the verb is an auxiliary, it occurs before the object but lexical verbs typically occur after the object
\begin{exe}
\ex \gll Ne sceal he $[$naht unaliefedes$_{object}]$ $[$don$_{verb}]$ (Pastoral Care, 10.61.14)\\
not shall he nothing unlawful do\\
\glt \textquote{He will do nothing unlawful}
\end{exe}
\end{footnotesize}
\end{frame}

\begin{footnotesize}
If the sentence is introduced by an adverb: VSO or VOS
\begin{exe}
\ex For\textthorn on $[$afligde$_{verb}]$ $[$Gregorius$_{subj}]$ $[$\textthorn one guman$_{obj}]$ \\
\ex For\textthorn on $[$afligde$_{verb}]$ $[$\textthorn one guman$_{obj}]$ $[$Gregorius$_{subj}]$ \\
\glt \textquote{Therefore Gregorius made the man flee.}
\end{exe}
If the subject is a pro-form it typically precedes the verb: SVO
\begin{exe}
\ex For\textthorn on $[$he$_{subject}]$ $[$afligde$_{verb}]$ $[$\textthorn one guman$_{obj}]$ \\
\glt \textquote{Therefore he made the man flee.}
\end{exe}
Similar to PDE

\frametitle{Languages in comparison}
Sequencing is not unlimited, i.e. the number of grammatically accepted combinations is limited.
\begin{itemize}
\item Some languages achieve via inflection (Latin) what other languages achieve syntactically (English).
\end{itemize}
\begin{exe}
\footnotesize{\ex The boy sees the girl. $\neq$ The girl sees the boy. }
\ex \footnotesize{ Puer videt puellam. = Puellam puer videt. = Puer puellam videt. = Videt puer puellam.}
\end{exe}
\begin{itemize}
\item In English the grammatical information (subject vs. object) is encoded in the word order, while the same information is encoded in case marking in Latin (nominative = subject; accusative = direct object).
\item Languages are categorized according to how they encode grammatical information.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Creation of morphological marking}
\begin{itemize}
\item Generally speaking, there is a trend across all Indo-European languages to develop from synthetic to analytic
\item This process started long before Old English as inflection/conjugation of Old English is relatively poor compared to the inflection/conjugation of Proto-Indo-European
\item But there are examples of the opposite trend as languages occasionally develop inflections/conjugations
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Creation of morphological marking}
\begin{itemize}
\item In standard BrE and standard AmE, there is no distinction between singular \textit{you} and plural \textit{you}
\end{itemize}
\begin{exe}
\ex StBrE and StAmE\\
SG \textit{you} vs PL \textit{you}
\end{exe}
\begin{itemize}
\item Several varieties are introducing a distinction between SG \textit{you} and PL \textit{you}:
\end{itemize}
\begin{exe}
\ex IrE and ScE\\
SG \textit{you} vs PL \textit{youse}
\ex SAmE\\
SG \textit{you} vs PL \textit{you all} or \textit{yall}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is grammaticalization?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Grammaticalization can be \textquote{defined as the development of grammatical constructions out of more lexical expressions.} \citep{hollmann2009grammatical}
\item Grammaticalization is the process whereby lexical items develop into grammatical items and items that are already grammaticalized assume new grammatical functions. \citep{hopper2003grammaticalization}
\end{itemize}
Grammaticalization is a unidirectional process during which (new) grammatical constructions develop from less grammatical (lexical) constructions.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Mechanisms and Features of Grammaticalization}
\begin{itemize}
\item Desemanticization (semantic bleaching)
\item Extension (new functions are acquired)
\item Subjectification (new meaning is more subjective)
\item Decategorialization (change of word class)
\item Erosion/Attrition (morphological/phonological material is lost)
\item Persistence (older forms continue to exist)
\item Loss of constituent structure (constituency boundaries change)
\item Unidirectionality (lexical $\rightarrow$ grammatical)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Mechanisms and Features of Grammaticalization}
Desemanticization (semantic bleaching)
\begin{itemize}
\item There is an observable grammaticalization cline from concrete/objective/physical meaning to a metaphorical/subjective/abstract meaning.
\end{itemize}
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\begin{xlist}
\ex I'm \textit{going} to Mary later on. (physical act of going/walking)
\ex I \textit{go} to school. (attendance)
\ex I'm \textit{going} to watch a movie. (intention/volition)
\ex I'm \textit{gonna} wash the dishes later on. (futurity)
\end{xlist}
\ex go (motion) $\rightarrow$ gonna (aux)
\ex have (poss) $\rightarrow$ have (aux)
\ex that (pointing) $\rightarrow$ the (definiteness)
\end{exe}
\end{footnotesize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Mechanisms and Features of Grammaticalization}
Extension (new functions are acquired)
\begin{itemize}
\item The concrete lexical meaning is lost while a more abstract grammatical function/meaning arises.
\end{itemize}
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{exe}
\ex I'm \textit{going} to Mary later on. (physical act of going/walking)
\ex I \textit{go} to school. (attendance)
\ex I'm \textit{going} to watch a movie. (intention/volition)
\ex I'm \textit{gonna} wash the dishes later on. (futurity)
\end{exe}
\end{footnotesize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Mechanisms and Features of Grammaticalization}
Subjectification (new meaning is more subjective)
\begin{itemize}
\item The concrete and objective lexical meaning gives rise to a more subjective meaning.
\end{itemize}
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{exe}
\ex He \textit{can} lift the stone. (physical/objective ability)
\ex He \textit{can} oversee the troops. (metaphorical/cognitive ability)
\ex \textit{Can} you pass me the salt? (subjective/intention/volition)
\end{exe}
\end{footnotesize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Mechanisms and Features of Grammaticalization}
Decategorialization (change of word class)
\begin{itemize}
\item During the acquisition of a new grammatical function, words change their status with respect to the word classT they belong to.
\end{itemize}
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{exe}
\ex
\begin{xlist}
\ex I'm \textit{going} to Mary later on. (part-of-speech: lexical verb)
\ex I'm \textit{going} to watch a movie. (part-of-speech: auxiliary verb)
\end{xlist}
\ex
\begin{xlist}
\ex He had only \textit{one} army. (part-of-speech: determiner (numeral))
\ex He had \textit{an} army. (part-of-speech: determiner (indefinite article))

Erosion/Attrition
\begin{itemize}
\item morphological/phonological material is lost
\item attrition: phonetic reduction
\end{itemize}

Persistence
\begin{itemize}
\item Polysemy: archaic variants continue to exist alongside the new grammaticalized form
\end{itemize}

Cognitive Semantics (Prototype Semantics)
\begin{itemize}
\item Since about the 1980s language is understood as part of our cognitive ability through which we organize and classify all aspects of our experience.
\item Cognitive semantics is based upon the assumption that meaning is linked to the way we mentally group all kinds of perceptions and phenomena into conceptual categories.
\item Categorization and conceptualization are based on the comparison of new things with ones we already know and the resulting cognitive construction of similarities between different entities.

Cognitive Semantics (Prototype Semantics)
\begin{itemize}
\item Some concepts of expressions like the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES are rather clear-cut, while other concepts like those of STRONG or TALL are rather fuzzy.
\item Fuzzy concepts are characteristic of the human conceptual system.
\item Many concepts do not only have fuzzy boundaries, but can also be graded according to their typicality.
\item For example, \textit{robins} and \textit{sparrows} are more birdlike, i.e. more prototypical than \textit{penguins} or \textit{ostriches}.
\item Prototypes, such as \textit{robins} for the concept BIRD are cognitive reference points.

Melioration
\begin{itemize}
\item Semantic change that results in a more positive meaning
\end{itemize}
\begin{exe}
\ex rude (bad): \textit{Don't be so rude} $\rightarrow$ rude (cool): \textit{He's a rude boy}
\ex nice (simple, naive): \textit{She was a nice girl} $\rightarrow$ nice (kind): \textit{That's very nice of you!}
\end{exe}
Pejoration
\begin{itemize}
\item Semantic change that results in a more negative meaning
\end{itemize}
\begin{exe}
\ex pretty (cunning): \textit{He was a very pretty man.} $\rightarrow$ pretty (handsome): \textit{He's a pretty boy}
\ex sinister (left): \textit{on your sinister side.} $\rightarrow$ sinister (evil): \textit{What a sinister deed!}

Specialization/Narrowing
\begin{itemize}
\item Semantic change that results in a more restricted/narrow meaning

The word \textit{silly} underwent a pejoration from meaning \textit{blissful} or \textit{blessed} to \textit{ignorant}
\begin{itemize}
\item What we have here is a gradual process during which the meaning of the word \textit{silly} is re-analyzed repeatedly and the category boundaries shifted due to metaphorical extension in a chain-like manner from one meaning to a very similar one until the end-poles of that gradual process are quite distinct.

\begin{itemize}
\item Are there patterns underlying semantic changes or is it rather a anything-goes situation?
\item Subjectification (change from relatively objective meanings into increasingly subjective ones)
\item Case study on \textit{very}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Mechanisms of Change: Case Study on \textit{very}}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word \textit{very} was introduced into English in the aftermath of the Normal Conquest when it meant \textit{true} or \textit{real} (Mod. French \textit{vray}, \textipa{/vre/}, still means exactly that)
\item Related PDE words still have that meaning component ( \textit{verify}, \textit{veracity}, \textit{veritable})
\item ME: \textit{a very knight} (a real/true knight that was either born or knighted $\leftarrow$ objective criterion)
\item PDE: an very interesting area (subjective judgement)
\item Intensifiers often derive from adjectives meaning true or real (\textit{right}, \textit{really}, \textit{real})
\item Unidirectionality of subjectification\\
objective $\rightarrow$ subjective (counter example: \textit{gay})
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Investigate the use of the word \textit{gay} in the COHA corpus.
\item Select ten examples for each decade and determine whether the meaning is \textit{jolly}|\textit{lucky}|\textit{friendly} or \textit{homosexual} or unclear.
\item Plot the ratio of the three alternatives over time.\item What does the plot show? Does it indicate a shift/change in meaning?
